  loyalty:
  - 'Your advisors were not loyal and conspired against you.


    You were taken to a dank basement, executed and promptly replaced.'
  - "The overwhelming praise and loyalty of your followers went to your head.\r\n\nBelieving
    you were a God, you refused to eat and starved to death."
  might:
  - "Your ruling iron first turned limp, leaving your defences weak.\r\n\nCounter-revolutionaries
    stormed the government building and killed you."
  - "Your tight grip on freedom left your citizens with nothing to lose.\r\n\nThe
    People banded together and overwhelmed your military power, killing you in the
    process."
  influence:
  - "Your lack of influence caused you to lose support.\r\n\nSlowly, your government
    dissolved and you were locked up for your crimes."
  - "Your influence sent a massive shockwave of fear to the outside world.\r\n\nNumerous
    foreign powers united against you, plunging your country into a 2-year war which
    would end in your demise."
